The goal is to create an application that allows developers to easily distribute their work roms/themes/apps (specifically apps that can't be put on the android market (wifi tether) mods ect...I'd like to integrate developer profiles into the application too which would allow for easy access to donate information to help the devs get money for contributing to the android community.
